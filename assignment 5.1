Class Employee {
  string name;
  int age;
  float salary;
  public : string getName();
  void setName(string name);
  int getAge();
  void setAge(int age);
  float getSalary();
  void setSalary(float salary);
};
Employee employee;

In the upper mentioned example "employee" is data structure since it is not following proper encapsulation and dta in also exposed by gater and setter function.
since a object is something where molding the data using method is not possible. here we are using getter and setter for accessing hte data without having any true functionality.
but on the other hand when we are using object then the methods are used for giveing some meanningfull fuctionality.
